# Design Values

## Use restraint

Don't make a decision until we have to. Designers should focus on the basic product features using minimal design elements to express the solution. As Antoine de St.Exupery said:

> “Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away”

## Simplicity &lt; Clarity

> The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is not the same as simplicity… Complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless “bite-sized” chunks of data, as simplification usually does. Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often responsible for the “dumbing” of information rather than the illumination of it.  
> **– Michael Hoffmans**

## Guess less

Quantitative and Qualitative research - numbers give the illusion of certainty \(quantitative\) but can be misleading if not verified with qualitative information

## Be the apprentice for our customers

Always be asking:

> How can I help our customers be the best GRC professional possible? What repetitive task can I take off their plate? What source of frustration can I seek to eliminate?

## Story first

Know **why** we do what we do. A product story answers a simple question:

> How will this product \(feature\) fit into the lives of others?
